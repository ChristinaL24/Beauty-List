# Beauty-List ðŸ’„

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for beauty enthusiasts who want to browse beauty products. 

From stealing my mother's beauty products as a child to now creating a front-end beauty application, makeup has always been a creative and integral tool that has allowed me to creatively express myself. I created this project so that beauty enthusiasts (just like myself) could browse through popular beauty products.
